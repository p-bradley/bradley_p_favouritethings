# Favourite Things

## Description:
Favourite Things is a one page website allowing users to see my favourite three things in the world.
<br>
The site features 3 icons of my favourite things along with 3 other images which are shown once the user clicks on the photo.
<br>
If the user accidentally searches for something on the page that does not exist, an error message prompts them to return to the
<br>
previous page

## Setup: 
To use the database, use PHPmyAdmin or a mySQL terminal to pull the information to your computer, tablet, phone
<br>
locally. When viewing the site, open a terminal and type npm install, which will install all needed packages.
<br>
If you are on Mac, in the config.js the port should read as "8889" and the username and password as "root"
<br>
Windows user should use "3000" and should not inlcude a password.
<br>
The URL should read as localhost:3000 and the site will be up and running!

## Programs Used:
I used VSCODE to write the code, along with 3 programming languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
<br>
The site also includes databses created using PHP

## Creator:
W. Patrick Bradley

## Future:
I only have 3 favourite things in the world. In the future I may have 4. Maybe 5. But for now only 3. We'll see what may come.
